Hello, I completed the project. The project is a url shortener where one submits his url and the shortened version is displayed in the table.I have the work on github in the following repos
https://github.com/naxoduor/url-shortener-frontend
https://github.com/naxoduor/url-shortener-backend
For the front end application you can use
npm install
docker-compose up --detach
to install dependencies and run when in the root directory
while for the backend application
docker-compose up --detach
will work

I also have the application running at
http://104.248.73.139:8080/
